# samantha-widget

Samantha as a floating strip at the bottom of the screen. GTK4 on X11.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-samantha-widget-gtk4-design.md`

## Setup

    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
    .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"

`--system-site-packages` is required: PyGObject and the GTK4 typelib
come from the system (`python3-gi`, `gir1.2-gtk-4.0`), not from pip.
Without the flag, `import gi` fails and nothing here runs.

That flag has a second, less obvious effect: **pip treats packages
already installed system-wide as satisfied**, so `pip install pytest`
can be a no-op that leaves the venv quietly depending on the system's
copy. Use `--ignore-installed` for anything that must be pinned here:

    .venv/bin/pip install --ignore-installed pytest

(Doing that prints a warning about `langfuse` wanting an older
`packaging`. It is a system package, unrelated to this one, and it is
only visible at all because of `--system-site-packages`.)

## Run

    DISPLAY=:1 .venv/bin/python -m samantha_widget

## Test

    .venv/bin/python -m pytest -v
    .venv/bin/ruff check . && .venv/bin/ruff format --check .

## Verifying anything visual

Nothing about this program's appearance is provable from a test. Capture
the screen and look at it:

    ffmpeg -y -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -i :1 -frames:v 1 /tmp/strip.png
